Adding Content
==============

Adding content to Frog is as simple as dragging stuff from your desktop onto the site.  It will upload and do any conversions neccessary and add them to the current Gallery.  You can also click the Upload button on the toolbar at the top to bring up a familiar file selection dialog.
