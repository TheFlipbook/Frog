Tagging has been made pretty easy in Frog.  You can select images and click the Edit Tags button or hit the TAB key to bring up the dialog.  Here you'll have three columns:

- Tags to add to all selected items
- Tags that are on at least one of the selected items
- Tags to remove from all selected items

You can type in the name of a new tag or it will autocomplete for existing ones.  You can also drag the tags to the different columns for quick addition or removal.
