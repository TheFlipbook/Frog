Copy to Gallery
---------------

This will be how you create new galleries and copy or move content between them.  If you're creating a new gallery, simply fill in the field in the top section and all selected pieces will be added to the new gallery.  If you want to copy or move pieces, choose the gallery from the bottom part of the dialog.  Use the Move Items checkbox to move the pieces rather than copy them.
