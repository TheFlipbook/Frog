Search & Filter
===============

Searching and filtering is done by typing in your query into the search box at the top of Frog.  It will autocomplete on known tags or you can just search for whatever you'd like.

Advanced Search
---------------

By clicking the Filter button on the toolbar at the top, you'll be able to do some more complicated searches.  How this works is everything in each row is OR'ed together and the rows are AND'ed together.  For example, say you wanted to find all images from Donetello or Michelangelo that was tagged with sculpture.  You would put the two artists names in one row and the "sculpture" tag in the next.  Sounds complicated, but it's really easy to use.
